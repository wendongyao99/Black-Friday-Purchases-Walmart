    "# Final Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data, we have gathered key insights about customer spending patterns based on age, gender, marital status, city category, and product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actionable Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Age** feature, we observed that ~ 80% of the customer's who belong to the age group 25-40 (40%: 26-35, 18%: 18-25, 20%: 36-45) tend to spend the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **Gender** feature, ~75% of the number of purchases are made by Male customer's and rest of the 25% is done by female customer's. This tells us the Male consumers are the major contributors to the number of sales for the retail store.On average the male gender spends more money on purchase contrary to female, and it is possible to also observe this trend by adding the total value of purchase.\n",
    "    - Average amount spend by Male customers: 9,25,408.28\n",
    "    - Average amount spend by Female customers: 7,12,217.18\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we combined Purchase and Marital_Status for analysis (60% are Single, 40% are Married). We came to know that **Single Men spend the most during the Black Friday**. It also tells that Men tend to spend less once they are married. It maybe because of the added responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an interesting column Stay_In_Current_City_Years, after analyzing this column we came to know **the people who have spent 1 year in the city tend to spend the most**. This is understandable as, people who have spent more than 4 years in the city are generally well settled and are less interested in buying new things as compared to the people new to the city, who tend to buy more (35% Staying in the city since 1 year, 18% since 2 years, 17% since 3 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When examining the City_Category which city the product was purchased to our surprise, even though the **city B** is majorly responsible for the overall sales income, but when it comes to the above product, it majorly purchased in the **city C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total of 20 product_categories are there. **Product_Category - 1, 5, 8, & 11** have highest purchasing frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 20 differnent types of Occupation's in the city.\n",

    "# Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Men spent more money than women**, So company should focus on retaining the female customers and getting more female customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Product_Category - 1, 5, 8, & 11** have highest purchasing frequency. it means these are the products in these categories are liked more by customers. Company can focus on selling more of these products or selling more of the products which are purchased less.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unmarried customers** spend more money than married customers, So company should focus on acquisition of married customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customers in the age 25-40** spend more money than the others, So company should focus on acquisition of customers of other age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The tier-2 city called B** has the highest number of population, management should open more outlets in the tier-1 and tier-2 cities like A and C in order to increase the buisness."
